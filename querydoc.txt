This clearly hints that Apple has planned a tie-up with Reliance and could sell the devices with a zero down payment plan. In October, there was buzz around Reliance’s new payment plans for the new iPhones. The leaked plans revealed  the iPhone 6 would start at Rs 3,099 per month for 24 months and the iPhone 6 Plus at Rs 3,599 per month for 24 months. However, the Reliance e-store hasn’t listed the device yet.

This isn’t something new as last year the service provider had introduced the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c at similar zero down payment plans. One could buy the 16GB iPhone 5s at a monthly fee of Rs 2,999 and 16GB iPhone 5c for a monthly fee of Rs 2,599, sans the need for any down payment.

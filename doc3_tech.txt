Looks like Cupertino tech giant Apple just can't get enough of the 4-inch form factor for its iPhone devices. The company that recently gave in to the 'bigger is better' phenomenon with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones is now reportedly working on a new a 4-inch iPhone. However, there's a twist! Buzz has it that Apple is working on a new 4-inch mini version of the yet-to-be-announced iPhone 6s expected to be launched sometime in 2015.

A new report by AppleInsider suggests that the year 2015 might see the launch of as many as three new iPhone devices: a 4.7-inch iPhone 6s, a 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus, and the afore-mentioned  4-inch iPhone 6s mini. The report quotes Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri as saying that the iPhone 6s mini could boast of almost similar specifications set as the iPhone 5s, however it could come iPhone 6-like curved screen edges.

Moreover, the alleged iPhone 6s Mini could cost less (exact estimation still unknown), meaning it could come with slightly low cost components. Reports also suggest that the purported device could be a replacement for Apple's low-end iPhone 5c.

There is however no word yet from Apple concerning the devices. If however, the reports do come true, 2015 could be a really busy year for the company that is currently generating rave reviews for its new iPhones and iPads.

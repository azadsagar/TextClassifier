WASHINGTON: NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have beamed their greetings to the Earth, wishing everyone a merry Christmas.

Expedition 42 Commander Barry Wilmore and Flight Engineer Terry Virts of NASA offered their thoughts and best wishes to the world for Christmas on the behalf of the crew aboard the space station on December 17.

"This is definitely going to be a Christmas that we'll remember, getting a chance to see the beautiful Earth, and I hope that for you also it will be a memorable Christmas this year," said Virts.

They were joined by a Christmas tree complete with trimmings, floating between the two astronauts as they delivered their message to people on Earth, 'Tech Times' reported.

Aside from a floating Christmas tree, the astronauts also have Christmas stockings, allowing them to share in the gift-giving tradition despite being hundreds of miles away from their loved ones
